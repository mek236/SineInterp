This is the template file you can use to write your own interpolation 
algorithms with for the group project. 

There are four files included: sineTest.h, sineTest.cpp, Makefile, LinearSine.h.

Under Linux (and Macs), you go into the directory with the four files, and type
    make
which should compile a program "sineTest". Then if you type
    ./sineTest
it should run the program and give you the time taken. (Depending on how
your paths are set, you may not need the initial ./). 

Linearsine.h is an example of what you should write. You need to change 
a couple of lines in sineTest.cpp and Makefile for your own file to work,
but most of the work should be done in a separate file (e.g. PolynomialSine.h).
The lines that needs to be added in sineTest.cpp and Makefile are indicated 
by comments.
